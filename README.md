Adjust the color of the screen of your Nintendo Switch.

# Overview

## Temperature/color:
  - Use the temperature slider to select the desired shading.
  - You can override the color by using the RGBA sliders.
  - The "Alpha" value controls the opacity of the layer.
  - Due to the way Fizeau works, it is sadly not possible to directly modify
        the screen color. Instead, it creates a transparent layer and applies
        color to it. However, this can lead to an overall increase of luminosity,
        especially visible with dark colors.
  - Additionally, the layer is not visible in screenshots/recordings.

## Dawn/dusk:
  - When set, Fizeau will start at the "dusk" hour and shutdown at the "dawn"
        hour.
  - You can override this by using the checkbox. Fizeau will then stay in the
        specified state.

## Settings:
  - Settings are saved at /switch/Fizeau/config.ini, which you can also edit.
  - To reduce the memory usage of the sysmodule, settings are not read
        continually. Instead, they are applied on application launch.
  - Thus, you will need to launch the client after a reboot to restart Fizeau.
